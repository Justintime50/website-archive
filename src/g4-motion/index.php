            <h3>Basketball Knee Sleeve</h3>
            <p>G4 Motion Basketball Knee Sleeves will protect you from potential knee and leg injury with the use of
                honeycomb technology. This technology is based on nature’s perfect design. Each hexagon works together
                to individually conform to the shape of your knee while slowing down and lessening the impact of force
                to your joint. The geometric shapes of the honeycomb structure also uses minimal materials making the
                sleeve easy to wear while providing maximum protection.</p>
            <p>Our Basketball Knee Sleeve was created to be comfortable so that athlete could focus more on their game
                and less on their equipment. The sleeve is made from high quality smooth elastic polyester fabric that
                is absorbent and breathable. Inside the seam is flatlock so it won’t irritate the skin when you are
                wearing the knee sleeve. We have also included a soft silicone strip at the top of the sleeve to prevent
                it from sliding down and getting sweaty during use.</p>
            <p>At G4 Motion we want to provide all athlete with the equipment they need to get them out and keep them
                playing the sports they love. Grab a knee sleeve, a few friends and start playing!</p>
