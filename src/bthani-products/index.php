        <h2>Ceramic Kitchen Knife Set of 5 with Chef’s Knife, Utility Knife, Fruit Knife, Paring Knife, Peeler, and
            Sheaths (Black or Multicolored with White Blades)</h2>
        <br>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>This ceramic kitchen knife set comes with four different knives and one peeler. Choose between our
                    black set or our multicolored set with white blades. The first knife in the set is a six inch chef’s
                    knife. This large knife is suitable for a variety of uses in the kitchen, like slicing boneless
                    meat, vegetables, and fruit. The second is a five inch utility knife. This knife is also suitable
                    for a variety of slicing needs. The third is a four inch fruit knife perfect for slicing fruit. The
                    fourth is a three inch paring knife. This small knife is suitable for peeling fruits and vegetables.
                    All four of these knives have ceramic blades made from zirconia, smooth edges, and triangular
                    points. In addition to these four knives, we’ve also included a peeler for removing the skin of
                    vegetables and fruits. Ceramic knives are superior to stainless steel knives in that they are
                    significantly harder. In fact, zirconia is second in hardness only to diamond. Because of this
                    hardness, ceramic knives are very sharp and able to retain their sharp cutting edge up to ten times
                    longer than metal knives. That means you won’t need to regularly sharpen these knives as you would
                    metal knives. Because they are very sharp, we’ve included four sheaths that cover the blades and
                    prevent accidents. These ceramic knives have non-reactive blades that are resistant to oils and
                    acids. Thus, unlike other knives, these knives will not change the original taste, smell, or color
                    of the food you are cutting. Additionally, these knives are rustproof and stain resistant, and they
                    won’t absorb any food elements. This makes them extremely easy to clean—all they need is a quick
                    rinse. Do not use a dishwasher to clean the knives, as they can chip. We also recommend using only
                    silicone, wooden, plastic, or bamboo cutting boards. Do not use these knives for carving, chopping,
                    boning, or prying. Our products have a 100% money-back satisfaction guarantee.</p>
